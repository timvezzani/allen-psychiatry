            <h2>4 Tips for Reducing Anxiety Yourself</h2>
            <p>When dealing with anxiety, consider these solutions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Limit Caffeine:</strong> Cut back on caffeine from soda,
                coffee, tea, chocolate, and certain medications. Eliminating these
                for a week may reduce anxiety and overreactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Distract Yourself:</strong> Dwelling on anxiety can reinforce
                it. Engage in enjoyable activities, have light conversations with
                friends, read, watch movies, take walks, or exercise to shift your
                focus.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Positive Self-Talk:</strong> Your mind responds to the messages
                it receives. Counter anxiety with reassuring messages such as "At
                this moment, I am safe." Remind yourself that most situations aren't
                as threatening as they seem.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deep Breathing:</strong> Use your body's natural tool by
                practicing slow, deep breathing for 1-5 minutes. Inhale and exhale,
                counting silently to 4 or 8. Combine this with positive self-talk
                for enhanced results.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
              Remember that these tips can complement professional treatment
              prescribed by your psychiatrist, psychotherapist, or primary care
              physician.
            </p>

          <div class="when-to-seek-help">
            <h2>When to Seek Help:</h2>
            <p>
              If anxiety is interfering with your daily life, it's important to
              seek professional help. Early intervention can improve outcomes
              and help you manage symptoms more effectively. Remember, anxiety
              is treatable, and you don't have to face it alone.
