          <h2>Understanding ADHD</h2>
          <h3>What is ADHD?</h3>
          <p>
            Adult ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) is a
            neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of
            inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with
            daily functioning. Symptoms may include difficulty focusing,
            disorganization, forgetfulness, restlessness, and difficulty
            completing tasks. These symptoms can impact work, relationships, and
            overall quality of life. Treatment often involves a combination of
            medication, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments.
