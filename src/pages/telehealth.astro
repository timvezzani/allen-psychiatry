        <h2>Mental Health Care That Fits Your Life</h2>
        <p>
          At Allen Psychiatry, we understand that getting to an in-person
          appointment isn't always possible or convenient. Whether you're
          managing a busy farming schedule, caring for family, or simply prefer
          the privacy of your own home, our TeleHealth services bring expert
          psychiatric care directly to you.
        </p>
        <h3>Designed for Rural Utah</h3>
        <p>
          We recognize the unique challenges faced by rural communities - from
          geographic isolation to the demands of agricultural life. Our
          TeleHealth platform bridges these barriers, providing the same
          high-quality mental health care you would receive in our Provo office,
          delivered through secure video technology that respects your schedule
          and privacy.
        </p>
        <ul class="telehealth-features">
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible Scheduling Around Your Life:</strong> Early morning
            sessions before chores, evening appointments after the day's work, and
            flexible timing that respects seasonal agricultural demands and family
            responsibilities.
          </li>
          <li>

            <strong>Crisis Support When You Need It:</strong> During challenging
