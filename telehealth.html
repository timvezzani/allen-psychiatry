          <h2>Mental Health Care That Fits Your Life</h2>
          <p>
            At Allen Psychiatry, we understand that getting to an in-person
            appointment isn't always possible or convenient. Whether you're
            managing a busy farming schedule, caring for family, or simply
            prefer the privacy of your own home, our TeleHealth services bring
            expert psychiatric care directly to you.
          </p>
          <h3>Designed for Rural Utah</h3>
          <p>
            We recognize the unique challenges faced by rural communities - from
            geographic isolation to the demands of agricultural life. Our
            TeleHealth platform bridges these barriers, providing the same
            high-quality mental health care you would receive in our Provo
            office, delivered through secure video technology that respects your
            schedule and privacy.
          </p>
          <ul class="telehealth-features">
            <li>
              <strong>Flexible Scheduling Around Your Life:</strong> Early
              morning sessions before chores, evening appointments after the
              day's work, and flexible timing that respects seasonal

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Complete Privacy & Discretion:</strong> No waiting rooms,
              no parking lot encounters - receive care from the privacy of your
              home, ranch, or office. Perfect for close-knit communities where
              privacy matters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Crisis Support When You Need It:</strong> During
              challenging times like drought, market downturns, or family
              crises, immediate support is available through our secure platform

          <blockquote>
            "Since working with Dr. Allen through TeleHealth, I can finally
            enjoy the sunset from my fields again. The flexible scheduling means
            I don't have to choose between my work and my wellness."
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "Living 45 minutes from the nearest town made getting help seem
            impossible. TeleHealth changed everything - now I have regular
            support without the drive."
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "The privacy of receiving care from home was exactly what I needed.
            No waiting rooms, no running into neighbors - just professional
            support when I need it most."
